# API Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Server-Side Fetch URL Resolution
**Problem**: Public pages were using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'` for server-side fetches, which defaulted to localhost in production.

**Solution**: Created a utility function that properly detects the environment:
- Uses `process.env.VERCEL_URL` for Vercel deployments
- Falls back to `window.location.origin` for client-side
- Uses localhost for development

### 2. Updated Files
- `src/lib/url.ts` - New utility functions
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Home page
- `src/app/culture/page.tsx` - Culture page
- `src/app/travel/page.tsx` - Travel page
- `src/app/guides/page.tsx` - Guides page  
- `src/app/lifestyle/page.tsx` - Lifestyle page
- `src/app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx` - Article detail pages

## Why Admin APIs Worked

Admin pages use `'use client'` and make fetch calls from the browser, which automatically uses the correct domain. Public pages use server-side rendering, which needed explicit URL configuration.

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Environment Variables (Optional)
Add to your Vercel environment variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Dynamic Route Configuration
Consider adding this to `next.config.ts` for better static generation:
```typescript
experimental: {
  dynamicIO: true,
}
```

### 3. MongoDB Connection Optimization
The warnings about duplicate indexes can be fixed by reviewing your Mongoose schemas.

### 4. Error Monitoring
Consider adding error tracking (like Sentry) to monitor API failures in production.

## Testing
The build completed successfully, indicating all syntax and import issues are resolved. Your public APIs should now work properly on Vercel.
